### 2) DEMOGRAPHIC MODEL

# Reference effective population size (Ne)
NREF=10000

# Demographic model in ms format, specifying population size changes over time
DEMO='-eN 0.0875 1 -eN 0.075 0.2 -eN 0 2'

### 3) LOCUS AND SAMPLE SIZE

# Length of the locus (genomic region) in base pairs (bp)
LEN=80000

# Mutation rate (theta) scaled by 4*Ne*LEN
THETA=48

# Recombination rate (rho) scaled by 4*Ne*r*(LEN-1)
RHO=32

# Number of chromosomal copies to simulate. For diploid organisms, this is typically twice the number of individuals
NCHROMS=198

### 4) SELECTION

# Relative position of the selected allele in the sequence (0.5 means the middle of the sequence)
SELPOS=0.5

# Initial frequency of the selected allele at the start of selection
FREQ=0.01

# Range of selection coefficients (selection strength), here we simulate weak selection scenarios (0 or 100)
SELRANGE=`seq 0 100 100`

# Number of replicates (simulations) per value of the parameter to be estimated
NREPL=1000

# Selection time scaled to coalescent units. Here it represents early selection (10kya)
TIMERANGE=0.01

# Number of batches for each simulation
NBATCH=10

# Number of threads to use for parallel processing
NTHREADS=4
